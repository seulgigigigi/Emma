<p>among ancient civilizations who regarded solar eclipses as an evil omen,<br>the sight of the cosmic phenomenon would have been cause for despair.<br> But for many enthusiasts traveling thousands of miles to see the upcoming solar eclipse on April 8, the opposite is true.</p>
<p>From a safety perspective, that, in fact, was not a bad precaution.</p>
That’s because there is a lot of damage the sun can do to the retina of the eye as the eclipse approaches and then passes totality—and that damage can affect your vision for life. So, if you’d like to bear witness to a celestial event that will not touch the U.S. mainland again until Aug. 23, 2044, while at the same time protecting your eyes and preserving your sight, here’s how best to observe today's total eclipse.
